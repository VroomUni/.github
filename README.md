# VroomUni

Introducing Vroom, the carpooling mobile app designed exclusively for university students. It streamlines transportation for students without a vehicle while helping those with cars save on expenses. Here's how we made it happen:

- Leveraged Geolib and jsts to craft an algorithm that suggests rides to passengers based on proximity.
- Implemented MySQL scheduled events, empowering drivers to effortlessly schedule recurring rides.
- Integrated Google Maps APIs to create and enhance map-centric features.
- Utilized a tech stack featuring React Native, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for seamless real-time notifications.

With Vroom, getting to and from campus has never been easier or more efficient.
