# VroomUni

Introducing Vroom, the carpooling mobile app designed exclusively for university students. It streamlines transportation for students without a vehicle while helping those with cars save on expenses. Here's how we made it happen:

- Leveraged [![Geolib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Geolib-Used-blue)](https://github.com/manuelbieh/geolib) and [![jsts](https://img.shields.io/badge/jsts-Used-blue)](https://github.com/bjornharrtell/jsts) to craft an algorithm that suggests rides to passengers based on proximity.
- Implemented [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Used-blue)](https://www.mysql.com/) scheduled events, empowering drivers to effortlessly schedule recurring rides.
- Integrated [![Google Maps APIs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Maps%20APIs-Used-blue)](https://developers.google.com/maps) to create and enhance map-centric features.
- Utilized a tech stack featuring [![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Native-Used-blue)](https://reactnative.dev/), [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-Used-blue)](https://nodejs.org/), [![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-Used-blue)](https://expressjs.com/), [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Used-blue)](https://www.mysql.com/), [![Firebase Authentication](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase%20Authentication-Used-blue)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), and [![Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase%20Cloud%20Messaging-Used-blue)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) for seamless real-time notifications.

With Vroom, getting to and from campus has never been easier or more efficient.
