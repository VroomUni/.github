Vroom is the carpooling mobile app designed exclusively for university students. It streamlines transportation for students without a vehicle while helping those with cars save on expenses.

### How We Made It Happen:

- Leveraged ![Geolib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Geolib-%23FFD600.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Geolib&logoColor=white) and ![jsts](https://img.shields.io/badge/jsts-%23FFD600.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jsts&logoColor=white) to craft an algorithm that suggests rides to passengers based on proximity.
- Implemented ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=MySQL&logoColor=white) scheduled events, empowering drivers to effortlessly schedule recurring rides.
- Integrated ![Google Maps APIs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Maps%20APIs-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Google%20Maps&logoColor=white) to create and enhance map-centric features.
- Utilized a tech stack featuring ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=%2361DAFB), ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-%23339933.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Node.js&logoColor=white), ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Express&logoColor=white), ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=MySQL&logoColor=white), ![Firebase Authentication](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase%20Authentication-%23039BE5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firebase&logoColor=white), and ![Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase%20Cloud%20Messaging-%23039BE5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firebase&logoColor=white) for seamless real-time notifications.

With Vroom, getting to and from campus has never been easier or more efficient.
